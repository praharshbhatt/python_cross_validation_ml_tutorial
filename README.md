# MACHINE LEARNING : Cross Validation (KNN, DT & RF algorithm's )

This tutorial covers how to use Cross Validation to pick out the best performing algorithm and create a model from it.


We will be using breat cancer data for this tutorial. Breast cancer data includes 569 observations of cancer biopsies, each with 32 characteristics (variables).
One feature is an identification number (ID), another is a cancer diagnosis, and 30 are numerical
laboratory measurements. The diagnosis is coded as "M" to indicate malignant or "B" for indicate benign.
